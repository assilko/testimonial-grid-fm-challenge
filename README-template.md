### What I learned

In this project, I learned to implement responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. Additionally, working with SVG images and optimizing layouts for various screen sizes was a valuable experience.
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I plan to continue refining my responsive design skills and explore more advanced features of CSS and JavaScript in future projects.

### Useful resources

### Useful Resources

- [Adobe Color Wheel Tool](https://color.adobe.com/) - This tool was invaluable for selecting and creating harmonious color palettes. It provides an intuitive interface for experimenting with colors and finding the perfect combination for my projects.

- [CSS Box Shadow Generator Tool](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This online tool simplifies the process of creating CSS box shadows. It allows you to visually adjust shadow properties, generating the corresponding CSS code. It has been a time-saver and a great resource for achieving the desired shadow effects in my designs.
